AbstractSpatialGraphs  are a subtype of LightGraphs.AbstractGraph, and can be weighted or directed. SpatialGraphs.jl is useful for turning spatial data into graphs. This can be useful for landscape connectivity analysis, hydrology, and other spatial network processes. AbstractSpatialGraphs are AbstractGraphs, methods from  LightGraphs.jl work right out of the box.  Go to Graph Types for more details on the graph types implemented in  this package.","category":"page"}]
