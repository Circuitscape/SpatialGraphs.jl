# SpatialGraphs.jl

SpatialGraphs.jl introduces the `AbstractSpatialGraph`, which is a subtype of `Graphs.AbstractGraph`.
SpatialGraphs.jl turns spatial data into graphs, which enables users to leverage the vast
functionality of Graphs.jl and other graph packages to analyze landscape connectivity, hydrology, and other spatial
network processes. This package implements the Graphs.jl interface, so methods
from Graphs.jl work right out of the box. Go to [Graph Types](@ref graph_types) 
for more details on the graph types implemented in this package.
