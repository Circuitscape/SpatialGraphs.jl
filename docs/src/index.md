# SpatialGraphs.jl

SpatialGraphs.jl introduces the `AbstractSpatialGraph`. `AbstractSpatialGraphs` 
are a subtype of `LightGraphs.AbstractGraph`, and can be weighted or directed.
SpatialGraphs.jl is useful for turning spatial data into graphs. This can be
useful for landscape connectivity analysis, hydrology, and other spatial
network processes. AbstractSpatialGraphs are AbstractGraphs, methods from 
LightGraphs.jl work right out of the box. 
Go to [Graph Types](@ref Graph Types in SpatialGraphs.jl) for more details on the graph types implemented in 
this package.
